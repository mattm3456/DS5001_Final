# DS5001_Final

This is the GitHub repository for my DS5001 final project.

I chose to analyze Shakespeare. 

FINAL_REPORT.ipynb contains a writeup of my findings. final_project_code_new.ipynb contains the code used to create the visualizations and analysis in the report; not every visualization in this notebook made it into the final report. In addition, certain elements were not present in the report (e.g. interactive visualization products), so be sure to examine the code as well.

Please enjoy.
